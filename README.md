# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the **Tic Tac Toe Game**! This is a classic two-player game built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game is simple, fun, and visually appealing, using images instead of text for the "X" and "O" marks.

## 🎮 **How to Play**
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Two players take turns. Player 1 plays as "O", and Player 2 plays as "X".
- Players take turns clicking on the grid to place their marks.
- The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins!
- When a player wins, the game announces the winner and disables further moves.

## ✨ **Features**
- **Player Icons**: Instead of the standard "X" and "O" text, custom images are used to represent each player's move.
- **Turn-Based Play**: Alternating turns between Player O and Player X.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects when a player has won and prevents further clicks on the board.
- **Reset & New Game Options**: Easily reset the board or start a new game using the buttons provided.
- **Responsive Design**: The game adapts to different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
